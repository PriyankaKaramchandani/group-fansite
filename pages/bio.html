                <div class="description">
                    Adrian graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in Computer Science and a 
                    minor in Theater and has spent the last seven years teaching high school computer
                    science and cybersecurity in Texas. He’s super excited to join Ada and help guide students
                    toward their goals. In his free time, you can catch Adrian exploring the outdoors or on
                    stage at one of Austin’s improv theaters. He’s also an avid baker and is always taking
                    suggestions for new recipes to make!

                    Ansel brings over a decade of industry experience ranging from bioinformatics to system-
                    integrated application development, having built and maintained large-scale data 
                    analysis platforms focusing on rapid response to stakeholder needs. His goal is to provide 
                    the tools, support, and encouragement for each student to achieve their own personal
                    success and instill in them the confidence to challenge the preconceptions of what others
                    think they can achieve.

                <div class="description">
                        Ashley graduated from Reed College before teaching kindergarten for a few years and
                        eventually went on to complete an immersive coding program at Dev Bootcamp. Before 
                        joining Ada, she worked as a backend developer. She’s thrilled to be combining her
                        passion for education with her technical skills at the Digital campus.

                <div class="description">
                        Kelsey graduated from UW Bothell and has a long career as a mobile software engineer. 
                        After years of great experiences as an internship and industry mentor, they wanted to 
                        work with Ada students to be what they do, rather than a small slice of their job. Outside 
                        of tech, they are a fan of all kinds of crafting and cosplay!

                <div class="description">
                        Hailing from Atlanta, Mikelle is a non-binary black programmer with love for mathematics
                        and music. After taking a number of courses at George Washington, they realized coding
                        was a passion for them. This newfound interest served as fuel for their programming
                        journey. Gaining experience in machine learning, engineering computation, consulting,
                        and more along the way, Mikelle now looks to help women and gender-expansive folks
                        break into the field!
